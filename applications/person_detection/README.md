# Person and car detection (MobileNet on microcontrollers)

(TODO introduction and summary, for now check [research/person-car-detection-research.ipynb](research/person-car-detection-research.ipynb) for full app development) 

It may be easier to open the notebook on colab, but keep in mind that if you do so some libraries will have to be installed on the runtime.

For the C/C++ code check [application/nucleo-h743-person-car-detection/Core](application/nucleo-h743-person-car-detection/Core) folder. 

# Demo
Inference time on ARM Cortex-M7: 1195 ms  
(TODO provide an actual good quality demo)
